# Multi-task Multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with applications in machine learning

We adopt a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework to explore the possibility of using short-term auxiliary signals to infer the performance on a primary objective in the long term. Applications include accelerating the selection of hyperparameter configurations in machine learning tasks, where auxiliary signals can be provided by gradients, time-series validation performance, etc.
